    <h1>File Paths & writing HTML</h1>
    <h3>(Lesson 9)</h3>
<b>File Paths</b>
  <p> A file path is the route you dictate to the computer in order to find a file. If you were working in the AI folder, you could find project.docsx’s relative path by telling the computer Documents/project.docx. </p>
    

    <b>When to use absolute and relative paths</b>
<p>It is best to use absolute paths when referring to files that exist outside your current computer. It is often best to use relative paths when you are referring to files that are on your current computer or server. This way, if the folder that contains the files is moved, the links between files does not break. Users that access the file remotely also have little problem linking the files.</p>

    <b>Enhanced Text Editors</b> 
<p>There are programs that help coders write code. The category is called enhanced text editors. These are programs that aid coders in writing ode by doing things like highlighting tags and components in different colors, auto-completing or auto-formatting tags, etc.</p>

    <b>Online IDEs</b>
<p>There are several online IDEs, but most of them require subscription or other payment in order to enjoy adequate functionality. Two IDEs that do have some free functionality are Replit and StackBlitz.</p>

    <b>Validation</b>
<p>There are several markup validation services available on the Web. A validation service to use could be the W3C validation service (https://validator.w3.org/) because it’s hosted by the W3C which is the organization that sets Web standards.</p>
