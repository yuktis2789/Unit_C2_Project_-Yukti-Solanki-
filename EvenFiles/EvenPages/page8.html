  <h3>(Lesson 7)</h3>
  <b>Recap: the Head</b>
<p> As we have learned, every web page has a head and body. The head is where the pageâ€™s metadata is found, along with everything else that is meant not to appear on the visible part of the page. </p>
<ins>Five types of things are found in the head: </ins>
 <ul>
   <li>Title: the title is what shows up at the top of the web page window or tab.</li>
   <li>Metadata: data that is invisible to the viewer, but is visible to web crawlers, and thus important when the page appears in search results.</li>
   <li>Styles: instructions to the web browser on how the web page should look. </li>
   <li> Scripts: JavaScript code that must run before the body of the web page loads. </li>
   <li> Links: important files that are linked to the page, including external CSS and JavaScript files.</li>
 </ul>
