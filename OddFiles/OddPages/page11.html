    <h1>Semantic Elements</h1>
<h3>(Lesson 10) last lesson yay!</h3>
<b>The div tag</b>
<p>HTML4 introduced the &lt;div&gt; tag which allowed web developers ot create divisions, or sections to their pages. Web pages soon had many divs containing different types of content. While useful, overuse of div elements can make it difficult to understand how the page is structured. The div tag is also a non-semantic element.</p>
<b>Other semantic tags</b>
    <pre>
&lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt; These tags mean the heading of the webpages in 
number descending order. 
&lt;a&gt; this tag means it is a hyperlink. 
&lt;button&gt; this tag name means a button element. 
    </pre>
<b>The benefits of semantic HTML tags</b>
      <p>The most important benefit of using semantic HTML tags would be the clearness that the code has because of it. There is a better understanding of the code since there is now a purpose and it is also well structured and organized so it behaves greatly as a semantic HTML tag. It is able to be more search engine friendly and much more readable to whatever and whoever is reading the code with semantic HTML tag.
